Issues:

    1) I was unable to determine how to keep Spotify from returning songs that did not explicitly match the search criteria.  i.e. Searching for "The Sign" returned songs that didn't match that title.
    2) Even when an exact macth was returned, it was not always the first returned. 
    3) I held off on coding the do-what-it-says function until can figure out the Spotify issue.
